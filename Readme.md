# Hack the Brain

### Who needs a mouse and a keyboard when you have your brain
This project let's you play the Pong game with your mind. 
The left Paddle is controlled with ``w`` and ``s`` keys, and the right paddle is controlled with the Muse headband. If you focus your mind, the paddle goes up, and if you relax the paddle goes down. 
Also you can change balls velocity with ``+`` and ``-`` keys
